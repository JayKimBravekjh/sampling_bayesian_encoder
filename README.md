# Sampling Bayesian Encoder
Experimental studies of my paper "Sampling Techniques in Bayesian Target Encoding" https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01317

The main github development effort for Sampling Bayesian Encoder is a public fork of category_encoders package and can 
be accessed at this github location: https://github.com/mlarionov/categorical-encoding/tree/sampling . 
This repository contains a copy of the file sampling_bayesian.py taken from the main repo.
